# Brainbear - A Quiz Web App
## Projekt Software Engineering (ISEF) @ IU
### Conception and prototypical implementation of a cooperative and collaborative online quiz system.
The goal of the case study is the conception and prototypical implementation of an online quiz system that supports students of the distance learning program of the IU in the consolidation of learning content in preparation for the exam.

The system to be designed should enable students to find answers to technical questions cooperatively and collaboratively. The focus is on playing and working together. Similar to the popular app Quizduell, students can, but do not have to, play against each other. Cooperative game models should also be explicitly included.

The system should be operable via Internet browser. The creation and input of the tasks/questions to be solved, including correct solutions and, if necessary, reasons for incorrect solutions, should also be taken into account. The question catalog should be able to be created and maintained cooperatively by all interested parties.

In addition to the conception, the basic usability of the prototypical implementation should be demonstrated and suitably documented for practical use. In particular, the requirements or prerequisites for the infrastructure to ensure continuous operation are also necessary.
